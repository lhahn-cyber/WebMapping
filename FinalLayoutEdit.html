            <p>The Trans-Alaska Pipeline started operating in 1977, after years of diffult construction. The engineers had to naviagte the difficult terrain and permafrost, developing unique construction techniques to cope with the frozen ground. The pipeline makes up a signifiant porction of Alaska's revenue every year and also provides work, however the pipeline did not come to be without incident.</p>
            <p>Despite years of opposition from both conservation groups and Indigenous people the pipeline was built in the 1970s. The groups cited concerns over habitat loss, the land of native people being used without them seeing any benefit, and changes to tradition caused by the pipeline scaring off wildlife (whales, caribou), however after many lawsuits it was determined other transportation would have greater environmental impact. Nixon signed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971, requiring Native groups to give up their land in return for federal land and $962.5 million.</p>
